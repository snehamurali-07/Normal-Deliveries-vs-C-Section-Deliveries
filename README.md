This project analyzes the distribution and frequency of normal (vaginal) vs. C-section deliveries, using two key 
lenses: 
1. Geographical Rate Comparison (Choropleth Maps): 
Visualize and compare regional differences in C-section and normal delivery rates using choropleth 
maps. This will help identify areas with unusually high or low C-section rates, potentially indicating 
systemic healthcare issues, cultural preferences, or policy-driven practices. 
2. Parity-Based Comparison (VBAC Focus): 
Investigate how parity—particularly in women with a previous C-section—impacts the likelihood of 
undergoing a repeat C-section vs. attempting a Vaginal Birth After Caesarean (VBAC). This section 
will explore VBAC success rates, and regional trends influencing delivery decisions.

Through these analyses, the project aims to uncover hidden trends and guide better decision-making in maternal 
healthcare policies, patient counselling, and resource planning.
